    <h1>Mickie's MiddleSchool FanFictions: The Quiz</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, my name is Mickie and I'm a nerd, always have been always will be. In middleschool I was a prolific writer of fanfiction (just because there was a lot of it doesn't mean it's any good) and luckly I had the good sense to never publish any of this on the internet. If the world was good these fanfics would never see the light of day, however I have recently found a google drive that contains over 500 pages of my unpublished middleschool/elemenryschool fanfiction. So as one would do if they found a google drive full of fanfiction I skimmed through a lot of it, cringed deeply, and wanted to tell the world about how fucking weird I was. The thing is I don't want to actually publish or send out 500 pages of this weird shit, (trust me it's weird even by fanfiction standards). I just want to give you a taste of middle School/ elementry School Mickie's mind.
    </p>

I mean I loved these two dimentional charachters I created they had backstories, families, friends I couldnt just leave them by the wayside of fogotten people in my life. So I decided to just keep everything the same and figure out a way to incorperate every other interest I had into this story. It started with Narnia that one was fairly simple because they were somewhat contemporary looking other than the magic stuff. I incorperated the rest of them by writing in all the contrivences I could in order for it to make sense. There was time travel, magic that was very inconsistent, sometimes teleporting. Also as a kid my family would move around a lot like about once a year. Whenever I would make friends in a new place and then I would move I would just add them to this expansive universe so it would be like I had this friend for years. I would write about the friendship and make up conversations and like say we knew wach other since childhood because I was jealous of people with really close long friendships. </DIV>

        <DIV ID="answerQ7C" STYLE="display:none"> You guessed right.I played Roller Derby throughout Middleschool and my derby name was Licenced to Kill Her and my number was 007 and I was so jealous of the girl who came up with Princess Slaiya that I named my self insert charachter after her. Also I would love to share with the group that this fanfiction is about a Lesbian, crime fighting, Roller Derby team (yes of course they fought crime and they did it on skates) and half of me loves that that sentence exists and I really want to remake it into like a serious book and the other half of me wants to go back in time and give this sexually confused child a hug, tell her she's gay and that she can stop writing now. I'm not going to lie I mainly put this question and the next one in because making up/ looking up themed derby names for the other answers is so fun. If I were to rename her now its a toss up betwee Dyke Vador and Obi-Wan Kenosebleed.</DIV>
